## 🔍 Key Concepts Covered

### The Magic of Mathematical Meaning
Discover how the famous equation **King - Man + Woman = Queen** works in embedding space, and why this mathematical relationship is revolutionary for AI systems.

### Multi-Dimensional Understanding
Learn why embeddings use 1,536 dimensions (OpenAI) or 384 dimensions (Sentence Transformers) and what each dimension might represent in terms of semantic meaning.

### Semantic Similarity in Action
See how embeddings can determine that "The cat sits on the mat" and "A feline rests on the carpet" are nearly identical in meaning despite using completely different words.
