Climate change is one of the most significant challenges facing humanity today. It refers to long-term alterations in temperature, precipitation patterns, sea levels, and extreme weather events. While Earth has gone through natural climate variations for millions of years, the current rate and scale of change are largely driven by human activities.

The primary driver of modern climate change is the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs), such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). These gases trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, creating a "greenhouse effect" that leads to global warming. These emissions primarily result from burning fossil fuels for energy, deforestation, industrial processes, and agricultural activities.

The consequences of climate change are far-reaching. Global temperatures have risen by more than 1°C since the pre-industrial era. Ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica are melting, contributing to rising sea levels. Many regions are experiencing more intense and frequent heatwaves, hurricanes, wildfires, and droughts. Ecosystems and wildlife are under stress, with many species facing extinction due to changing habitats.

Mitigation efforts involve reducing GHG emissions and enhancing carbon sinks. This includes transitioning to renewable energy sources like solar and wind, improving energy efficiency, reforestation, and carbon capture technologies. Adaptation strategies include building resilient infrastructure, improving disaster response systems, and developing drought-resistant crops.

International cooperation is crucial. The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, aims to limit global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, ideally aiming for 1.5°C. Countries are required to submit nationally determined contributions (NDCs) outlining their emission reduction targets.

Public awareness, political will, and scientific innovation are essential to addressing climate change effectively. Without immediate and sustained action, the impacts of climate change may become irreversible and catastrophic for future generations.
